# Assignments for week 1

## Task 1

Open the schematic-blink-1.png and pay attention to the schematic. There are four leds (i.e. led1=green, led2=yellow, led3=red, led4=blue). Write a code that can turn on/off the leds in  round robin fashion.
For example:
- led1 will be on for one second and then off for one second.
- then, led2 is on for one second and off for one second.
- then, led3 is on for one second and off for one second.
- then, led4 is on for one second and off for one second.
- then, it goes back to led1-led4 to be on and off in round robin fashion.

## Task 2
Using the schematic-blink-1.png, write a code that can turn on/off the odd leds and the even leds in round robin fashion.

For example:
- led1 and led3 will be on for one second and then off for one second.
- then, led2 and led4 is on for one second and off for one second.
- then, it goes back to odd leds and even leds to be on and off in round robin fashion.

## Task 3
Write a code based on the schematic-blink-2.png. There are led and push button. When button is pushed, the led will be on.
